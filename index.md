Name is Matt. I'm a programmer and a progamer, so I go by pgm.

Not actually a pro at gaming, but I like to think I could be!

General blog for anything I feel like might be worth adding here. Want a place to maybe have to reflect back on.

Could be programming, gaming, books, trips, etc. We'll see!
