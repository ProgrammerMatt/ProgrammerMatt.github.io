- title: "Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance: An Inquiry Into Values"
  author: Robert M. Pirsig
  summary: "Read this as part of a \"book club\" with some friends. Overall it is interesting but it is honestly more philosophical and rambling than I think I would have liked. About halfway through I decided to look for an audiobook version to help get through it more easily lol (https://primeaudiobook.com/zen-and-the-art-of-motorcycle-maintenance-audiobook/). It is a popular book and if you want to think a bit deeper and listen to Robert Pirsig stroke his own intellectual ego, it might be worth trying."

- title: "Staff Engineer: Leadership beyond the management track"
  author: Will Larson
  summary: Overall I think this book mostly reinforced things I already knew. It's interesting to see different opinions and paths to being promoted, though. It makes me think that really most engineers can get to the level if they are in the right place at the right time and are good at marketing themselves through either impactful work or mentorship.
