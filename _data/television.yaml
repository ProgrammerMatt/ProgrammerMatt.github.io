  platform: Netflix
  summary: "I never watched that 70's show in its entirety, just parts here and there when I was younger. Makes me want to give it a try. Very light show with quick episodes, kept my attention enough. Didn't seem super woke either which I appreciate."

  summary: I enjoy playing basketball more than watching basketball, but I've always really liked Adam Sandler. Even as a very casual basketball spectator, though, I enjoyed all the celebrities/pro players they managed to get into the movie.
